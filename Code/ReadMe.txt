This folder contains the Semantic Categorization Experiment.

SemCat2 is the main file to run the experiment. 
You will need to enter 'c' for the Chinese version of the task and 's' for the Spanish version of the task.

Participants will need to use the left and right arrows on their keyboard to respond even and odd respectively (regardless of language).

Output files contain the subject number, subjects initials and language of the task

Note that I've only enabled the left and right arrow keys, as well as spacebar and escape for this current version of the experiment

Press escape during any trial to quit the experiment

Also note that the final experiment will use an RT box instead of keyboard input
The current version is used for testing purposes (I haven't had access to an RT box)
